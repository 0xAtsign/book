## What to expect when you file an issue here

This is the repo for The Rust Programming Language, available at
https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/.

## Editions

There are two editions: first and second. The second is currently in
a draft state, the first edition is no longer being actively worked on.

Therefore, issues for the first edition of the book are worthwhile if you
are planning to submit a pull request, and want to discuss it first. But
as we aren't actively working on the first edition, general bugs will be
closed.
