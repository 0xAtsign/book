## What to expect when you file an issue here

This is the repo for The Rust Programming Language, available at
https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/.

## Editions

There are two editions: first and second. The second is currently in
a draft state, the first edition is no longer being actively worked on.

We accept pull requests for the first edition, but prefer small tweaks to
large changes, as larger work should be spent improving the second edition.

For the second edition, We are currently working with No Starch Press to bring it
to print. Chapters go through a number of stages in the editing process, and
once they've gotten to the layout stage, they're effectively frozen. After
the book goes to print, they will be un-frozen again.

For chapters that have gotten to the layout stage, we will likely only be
accepting changes that correct factual errors or major problems and not, for
example, minor wording changes.

Scroll all the way to the right on https://github.com/rust-lang/book/projects/1
to see which chapters have been frozen.
