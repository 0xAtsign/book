## What to expect when you file an issue here

This is the repo for The Rust Programming Language, available at
https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/.

## Editions

There are two editions: first and second. The second is currently in
a draft state, the first edition is no longer being actively worked on.

We accept pull requests for the first edition, but prefer small tweaks to
large changes, as larger work should be spent improving the second edition.

For the second edition, we are currently working with No Starch Press to bring it
to print. Chapters go through a number of stages in the editing process, and
once they've gotten to the layout stage, they're effectively frozen.

For chapters that have gotten to the layout stage, we will likely only be
accepting changes that correct factual errors or major problems and not, for
example, minor wording changes.

Scroll all the way to the right on https://github.com/rust-lang/book/projects/1
to see which chapters have been frozen.

After the book goes to print, here are our plans:

* The online version should stay close-ish to the printed version, for
  example, you should be able to look at listing 10-3 in the book and find
  listing 10-3 in the online version and copy-paste the code if you want to
  play with it. Major changes to correct errors should get documented in
  errata.
* There are multiple efforts starting to translate the online book into
  other languages. It would help the translations stay in sync if we're not
  constantly changing the text.
* Someday there might be a third edition, once there are enough large new
  features in Rust to warrant such a thing. We don't have any schedule in mind
  for that though, so if we were to leave PRs around unmerged, they might be
  open indefinitely.
