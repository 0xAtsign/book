    <nav id="TOC"><ul></ul></nav><p>There are two editions of &quot;The Rust Programming Language&quot;:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="first-edition/index.html">First edition</a></li>
<li><a href="second-edition/index.html">Second edition</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The second edition is a complete re-write. It is still under construction;
though it is far enough along to learn most of Rust; we suggest reading the
second edition and then checking out the first edition later to pick up some of
the more esoteric parts of the language.</p>
