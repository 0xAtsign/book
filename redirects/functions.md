% Functions

There is a new edition of the book and this is an old link.

> Function definitions in Rust start with `fn` and have a set of parentheses after the function name.
> The curly brackets tell the compiler where the function body begins and ends.
> We can call any function we’ve defined by entering its name followed by a set of parentheses. 

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");

    another_function();
}

fn another_function() {
    println!("Another function.");
}
```
