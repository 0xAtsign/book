% Release Channels

There is a new edition of the book and this is an old link.

> The Rust project uses a concept called ‘release channels’ to manage releases.
> New nightly releases are created once a day.
> Every six weeks, the latest nightly release is promoted to ‘Beta’.
> At that point, it will only receive patches to fix serious errors.
> Six weeks later, the beta is promoted to ‘Stable’.
