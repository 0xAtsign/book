% Ownership

There is a new edition of the book and this is an old link.

> Ownership is Rust’s most unique feature, and it enables Rust to make memory safety guarantees without needing a garbage collector.
>
> 1. Each value in Rust has a variable that’s called its _owner_.
> 2. There can only be one owner at a time.
> 3. When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.
