% if

There is a new edition of the book and this is an old link.

> An `if` expression allows us to branch our code depending on conditions.

```rust
fn main() {
    let number = 3;

    if number < 5 {
        println!("condition was true");
    } else {
        println!("condition was false");
    }
}
```
