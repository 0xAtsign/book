# Is Rust an Object-Oriented Programming Language?

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a way of modeling programs. It originated
with Simula in the 1960s and became popular with C++ in the 1990s. Many
competing definitions describe what OOP is; some definitions would classify
Rust as object oriented but other definitions would not. In this chapter, we’ll
explore certain characteristics that are commonly considered object oriented
and how those characteristics translate to idiomatic Rust. We’ll then show you
how to implement an object-oriented design pattern in Rust and discuss the
trade-offs of doing so versus implementing a solution using some of Rust’s
strengths instead.
